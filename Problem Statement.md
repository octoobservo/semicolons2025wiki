# Problem Statement: AI enabled observability

There is huge amount of observability data that is getting generated by monitoring systems such as Grafana/ELK/Prometheus etc. The amount of data generated with medium to large enterprises running their systems could range in the TBs/day.

GenAI can help to analyze the errors reported in the logs and drill down on the root cause of the error and the fix required. Further, it can help correlate the logs data with metrics data to identify anomalies and either causes.

The scope of this problem is to design and implement a system which can help analyze observability data and correlates with other data sets of O11y to bring out meaningful results.

## Proposed Solution

Consideration for RAG based architecture

Enterprise data should not be used for training the LLM

## Business Value

Build an accelerator for Persistent which can be showcased to customers to win AI enabled O11y proposals.

## Customer Involvement
